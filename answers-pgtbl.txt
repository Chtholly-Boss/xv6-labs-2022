fork can be speedup because each time we fork to get a child, we should copy so many things.
If we store them to the syscall page, the time consumed can be decreased.

page0 is the text containing codes and global datas, etc.
page1 is the guard page.
page2 is the stack page.
the process couldn't access the guard page,otherwise it will cause a segmentation fault.
the third to last page contain the heap.
